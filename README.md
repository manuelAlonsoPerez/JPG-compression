## DESCRIPTION

Algorithm that performs '.jpg' compresion method for a given image with matlab. We can compress the image choosing different compression rate levels by modifying the quantizier q factor inside oppgave2.m file.

## RUNNING THE PROGRAM

1.  Import the project to our Matlab projects folder
2. Add the project files to path
3. On Matlab console run
`oppgave2`

##NOTES
To see the effect of changing the compression rate, modify the q factor (best results between 0.1 - 32) and re run the program.
